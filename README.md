👋 Hello, world! I'm @calm-days, an iOS developer on a mission to create innovative and user-friendly apps that make people's lives easier.

🚀 With a passion for all things mobile, I love turning ideas into reality and bringing them to the app store for the world to see. I've worked on a variety of projects and am always eager to learn and grow as a developer.

🤝 Collaboration is key, and I'm looking for opportunities to work with other developers and designers to create amazing apps together. I thrive in a team environment and enjoy brainstorming and problem-solving with others.

📱 When I'm not typing away at my keyboard, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or indulging in my love of good food.

💻 Ready to collaborate on the next big thing? Let's connect and bring our ideas to life -> r.liukevich@gmail.com
